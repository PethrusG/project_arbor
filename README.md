# Project Arbor
Project Arbor is a fitness game for the Android OS where the user is presented with the task of keeping a tree alive. By walking and gathering kilometers with the application running on your phone you gather important resources for your tree which will be growing larger the further you walk. The real world weather is also an important mechanism in the game. If it rains you get the chance to collect rainwater on your walk or run and the same goes for sunlight when the forecast allows. By being active and taking care of yourself youâ€™re also taking care of your tree friend and helping it grow ever larger and flourish.
